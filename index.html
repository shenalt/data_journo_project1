                    Money has infiltrated our election system. <br><br>
        
                    This past cycle saw the most outside spending going into American elections of all time. $4.4 billion to be exact and has been part of a deeply concerning trend for the past fifteen years. <br><br>
        
                    <iframe title="Total Amount of Money in Outside Spending Towards Candidates' Elections by Political Party" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-RXLUL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/RXLUL/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="197" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
                    </script>
        
                    When it was all said and done, Democrats received $2.6 billion in outside spending money and Republicans received $1.8 billion. Kamala
                    Harris accounted for more than half of the spending from outside groups for Democrats, having north of $1.3 billion to play around with which more than tripled the amount of money
                    Donald Trump received from outside groups. <br><br>
        
                    More than half of the eye-watering four billion dollars of total outside spending came from sources that had either zero or partial disclosure.<br><br>
        
                    Ever since the decisions of the Supreme Court cases Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and SpeechNow v. Federal Election Commission in 2010, outside spending in American elections 
                    has exponentially increased. After more than a decade, it seems the decision to lift limits on corporate contributions towards elections had the shocking effect of releasing an endless amount of 
                    money into the election system.<br><br>

                    </script>
                    <iframe title="Total Amount of Corporate Contributions to Super PACs by Political Viewpoint of Super PAC" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-U7Gwi" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/U7Gwi/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="228" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
                    </script>
        
                    More broadly, Super PACs and the wealthiest individual donors heavily skewed conservative in terms of their contributions to candidates on the federal level.
