                    The miscarriage happened on a school day and after the weekend, Nicole Rice was back at work running an early childhood education center in Brooklyn carrying the enormous weight of losing a child while managing an entire staff, educating children and dealing with her job’s biggest headache: late payments from the city to keep her center operational.  <br><br>
        
                    “I had to have an emergency delivery,” said Rice. “I’m still traumatized by that.”<br><br>
        
                   Rice has had contracts with the DOE for four years for 3-K and pre-K classrooms and for four years, she says she has dealt with delayed payouts owed to her from the New York City Department of Education. In her first year contracting with the department, she claims she didn’t get her first scheduled payment until November. She recently received payment for her June term in August.<br><br>
        
                    “It’s like this constant battle and it takes a lot of my time from kids, from families, and that's what I really want to be doing,” said Rice. “Not fighting for when I'm going to get paid or how to raise salaries for my hardworking teachers. All of it is so unfair and we want to invest in our kids.”   <br><br>
        
                   This kind of budget dance isn’t unique to just Rice, other operators of early childhood education centers have had similar gripes with the city regarding late payments. Take Beatrice Hassinger who owns and runs the Treasure Island preschool in Bay Ridge and also contracts with the DOE. Hassinger also just recently received her payment for June and receives all of the funding for Treasure Island through them.  <br><br>
                    
                   “That’s the thing that everyone complains about is that it’s not done in a timely fashion,” says Hassinger referring to what other education center operators say in regards to obligated payments that are supposed to be doled out by the DOE. <br><br>

                    Hassinger admitted she tends to submit invoices late more often than not due to her busy schedule, which is one of the main contributors to delayed payments according to the DOE. <br><br>
        
                    After Hassinger’s former landlord refused to renew her lease at her old location which was then taken up by the DOE, she had to find a new building in the area. Luckily, she was able to apply for and receive startup funds from the department to relocate. However, it took over a year according to Hassinger for the moving funds she qualified for to come through. <br><br>

                    “I've had to transfer money out of my own personal account to cover payroll because I have not received payments in time from the DOE,” said Hassinger. “I'm not sure what other centers do, but I am looking into getting a line of credit.”  <br><br>

                    Which is something that is not uncommon among people that contract with the city to experience according to THE CITY reporting. <br><br>

                    The building Hassinger moved into had a higher rent to pay, of which she is behind on the payments but says she is lucky her landlord is understanding. Rice has also drawn from her personal savings account to float her business as well.   <br><br>
                    
                    “We understand that providers face various operational challenges, however, maintaining consistent funding practices helps ensure equity and program sustainability across all our providers and, in many cases, invoices cannot be processed until providers give us the required documentation,” said Associate Press Secretary for the NYC DOE Dominique Ellison. “Nevertheless, we always work to ensure our providers are paid fairly and properly, and we continue to work collaboratively with all providers to hear out their concerns and give our children the world-class education they deserve.” <br><br>
                    
                    City officials claim another large contributor to the delay in payments are understaffing issues at the department stemming from the pandemic which many agencies, the DOE included, have not fully recovered from. In Fiscal Year 2020, the DOE reached a peak of 13,646 active civilian employees, who make up non-teaching roles, and are now sitting at 13,560 civilian employees as of April of this year. <br><br>
                    
                    The city as a whole has struggled paying out contracts to nonprofits and other organizations with last year showing no improvement according to THE CITY reporting despite Mayor Eric Adams and city Comptroller Brad Lander making promises throughout the years to improve contracting services and get nonprofits and those entering into contracts with the city paid on time. <br><br>
                    
                    “Our administration invested a historic $167 million as a part of our ‘Best Budget Ever’ to commit — for the first time in New York City history — to annual funding for a citywide 3-K expansion and for pre-K students with disabilities,” said a City Hall Spokesperson. “We remain committed to ensuring our early childhood education providers are paid fairly, promptly, and with the respect their essential work deserves.” <br><br>
                    
                    So far, the problem still persists. In April, there were 7,000 pending unpaid invoices worth over $1 billion for contracts with the city that included organizations other than non-profits as well according to a report from the Comptroller's Office. <br><br>
                    
                    The City Council even held a whole hearing centered around accelerating the payment process to education centers in particular. <br><br>
                    
                    However, the delays for educators around the city continue. <br><br>
                    
                    Rice added 10 more seats to her 3-K program and now requires more funding from the city to stay operational with the added costs for the first months of the school term. However, the city is unable to send her payments owed to her in time so she must now take out a bridge loan recommended by the city to remain operational. <br><br>
                    
                    “It’s been three months at this point,” said Rice. “It doesn’t look that good for us.” <br><br>
